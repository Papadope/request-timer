**Burp Request Timer**

This extension captures response times for requests made by all Burp tools. 
It could be useful in uncovering potential timing attacks.

Results can be filtered by tool (Proxy, Scanner, Intruder Repeater), by 
target scope, and by matching a string in the URL.

Requires Java 8.
